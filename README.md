# Is your twitter friend actually Donald Trump in disguise?

After twitter banned @therealdonaldtrump, the American president went on to tweet from different twitter accounts related to the Trump campaign. Apparently, his media manager - Gary Coby (@garycoby) - offered President trump his own account. Twitter noticed and swiftly banned @garycoby as well.

I believe that the Trump campaign will have learnt from that event. So now, if ex-President Trump wishes to use someone else's account secretly, they won't announce it, so that they can post undettered.

So who's to say that your friend isn't actually <b>Donald Trump</b>?

## There's only 1 way to find out!

While he can change his profile details, we can assume that his tweets will remain somewhat similar! Humans are, after all, creatures of habit. So how can we figure out if your friend is secretly Donald Trump?

<i><b>Simple!</b></i>

We will see your friend's (or any public account's) recent tweets! And if they're similar to what DJT would have posted, I have some bad news for you :( We will be using the Levenshtein algorithm to compare your friends tweets to all of DJT's tweets over the past 6 months!

Simply run the program (assuming you have Twitter's API keys) and enter your suspect's username :)
